        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (192 grams) blanched almond flour</li>
            <li>2 cups (227 grams) confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>

            <li>1 cup (198 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>Food coloring paste (white or your choice)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients You Need for the Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups (347 grams) granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>5 medium egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1 pound unsalted butter, room temperature and cubed</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped out (or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Baking Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Gather ingredients</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the almond flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the almond flour mixture and pour in 3 egg whites. Using a rubber spatula, fold and stir to make a paste. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the granulated sugar and water in a small pot and stir to combine. Wet your fingertips or a pastry brush and wash down any sugar crystals on the side of the pot.</li>
            <li>Heat on medium-high heat without stirring until the mixture reaches 238 F on a candy thermometer.</li>
            <li>While you are waiting for the syrup to reach temperature, place the remaining 4 egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until they reaches medium peaks. Turn off the mixer and wait for the sugar syrup to reach temperature.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar syrup has reached 238 F, turn the mixer back on medium speed to bring the egg whites back together and slowly drizzle the syrup down the side of the mixer bowl in a thin, steady stream until fully incorporated in the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Turn the mixer on medium-high and continue beating until the egg whites are inflated, smooth, shiny, flexible, and still a little warm, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>If using food coloring, squeeze a few drops to reach your desired color into the meringue and whisk for another 5 seconds or until completely incorporated.</li>
            <li>Take a small amount of the meringue and fold it into the almond flour mixture to lighten it up.</li>
            <li>Fold about half of the remaining meringue into the almond mixture using broad strokes until few streaks are left.</li>
            <li>Fold the rest of the meringue into the batter until no streaks are left.</li>
            <li>Continue to fold the mixture until the batter slowly drips off the spatula like lava and slowly settles flat, not leaving any peaks.</li>
            <li>Prepare a piping bag with a 1/3-inch circle piping tip and pour some of the macaron batter into the bag.</li>
            <li>Pipe 4 small dots of batter directly onto each corner of a 12 x 17-inch sheet tray, then place a piece of parchment on top. This will prevent the paper from lifting up in the oven.</li>
            <li>Hold the piping bag vertically (perpendicular to the work surface) about a half-inch from the parchment and gently squeeze to pipe a 1 1/2-inch circle without moving the piping bag. Repeat, making sure to leave space in between each macaron, until all the batter is gone.</li>
            <li>Gently tap the tray on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Let sit for about 30 minutes until the surface of the macaron is dry to the touch. Preheat the oven to 300 F.</li>
            <li>Bake the macarons for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the shell is hard and the center is still chewy. Let cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Filling Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, add 1 1/2 cups (297 grams) sugar and the water and stir to combine. Wet your fingers or a pastry brush and wash off any sugar crystals off the sides of the pot.</li>
            <li>Place over medium-high heat until the sugar syrup reaches 238 F. Do not stir the syrup while it is cookingâ€”this will cause the sugar to crystallize.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, place the egg whites and salt into a stand mixer bowl fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until the whites become frothy.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar until fully combined. Turn the speed up to high and continue to whisk until medium-stiff peaks. Turn off the mixer and wait for the sugar syrup to reach temperature.</li>
            <li>When the sugar syrup reaches 238 F, remove the pot from the heat and turn the mixer back on low speed. Slowly pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl in a thin, steady stream until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Turn the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until it has doubled in size and the bowl is no longer warm to the touch. Ideally the meringue should be between 72 to 75 F. Make sure your butter is also within this temperature range.</li>
            <li>Turn the speed back down to medium and slowly add the butter chunks until smooth and fluffy. Add only a couple butter cubes at a time and wait for them to be incorporated before adding the next. Adding the butter too quickly can cause the meringue to deflate.</li>
            <li>Lower the speed and add the vanilla. Continue to mix until everything comes together into a beautiful silky smooth buttercream.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a piping bag with 1/4-inch circle piping tip.</li>
            <li>Fill the piping bag with the buttercream.</li>
            <li>Flip half of the macaron shells upside down and pipe a circle of buttercream onto each shell.</li>
            <li>Place the other half of the macaron shells on top of the buttercream. Make sure to pair similar-sized discs together for more consistent macarons.</li>
            <li>The macarons can be served immediately, but many say they are actually better after freezing overnight.</li>
